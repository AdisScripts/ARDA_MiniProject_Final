🐾 AnimalAR – Educational Augmented Reality App for Kids

AnimalAR is an interactive Augmented Reality (AR) application built in Unity using Vuforia Engine, designed to deliver fun and educational experiences for children.
By scanning real-world images of animals, users can bring animated 3D models of animals like Elephant, Tiger, and Bear to life.

🐘 Animated 3D Animal Models
Each animal includes real-time animations such as walking, eating, roaring, or sitting.

🌍 Plane Detection (Coming Soon)
Place animals anywhere in the real world using Ground Plane mode.

🎮 Interactive Control System (Upcoming)
Move, rotate, and scale animals with simple gestures.
Ability to delete or place multiple animals in a scene.
